# Unrestricted YouTube
A local version of YouTube that lets you watch every video on YouTube anonymously.

# Requirements
Like every project here, you first need to install everything.<br>
Follow the instructions here to install python.<br>
Then make sure you have installed these packages using `pip install [package name]`<br>

+ python-vlc
+ yt-dlp

# How to use
To run the program, just run `python stream.py`<br>
Then, it will ask you to put the video id, just write it down and press enter.<br>
Now wait for the program to process the video and show it to you.<br>

Currently the program just shows you the video, you can't change the position, but I'm working on it.
